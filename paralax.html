                <h1>Orcas vs Great Whites</h1>
                <p> 
                </p>
                <p>While Orcas and Great Whites are both high up on the food chain of the ocean, the Orca comes out on top.<br>
                The Orca is faster, with even older members of a pod having the capability of swimming up to <b>48 kph</b>.<br>
            Orca's are also much more intelligent, as far as we can tell, and hunt in groups by cornering their prey or, in the case of<br>
        the Great White, attacking from their blindspot.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="parallax"></div>

            <div>
                <p>Though Great Whites are, well, great, they still aren't the apex predators that Orca's are. This is what the young people call<br>
                    <b>Not Stonks</b>. Maybe if Great Whites hit the gym they would be able to obtain Faster-than-Light traveling.<br>
                    Orca's work together, not unlike humans, with language. Using their own frequency and pitches of sounds they can not only <br>
                    contact each other, they can also identify which one is speaking based off of the specific sounds. Just another advantage over the introverted<br>
                    Great White.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="parallax"></div>

            <div>
                <p>It isn't common that Orca's feast upon the banquet of Shark Fin soup, or Great White Liver, but it isn't complete unusual.<br>
                As is the case in False Bay, South Africa, when, in 2017, <b>5 Great White Sharks washed ashore</b> sliced open and their livers removed.
            Why would an Orca eat their liver though? That's because the liver of a Great White makes up 28% of its body fat. <br>
        Holding up to 400 litres of oil and 2 million kilocalories this meal on wheels is a dream come true for a pod of Orcas. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="parallax"></div>

            <div>
                <p>We come back to the argument of Orcas vs Great Whites, in the Grand Finale of which is the belt holder of Apex, we all know<br>
                that the Orca is the clear winner. Superior Intelligence, Cooperation, and the ability to travel at lightning speeds the Orca wins.<br>
            But why do we love Great Whites so much? Maybe it's the sight of all those teeth that it can't brush? Maybe it's the media telling us to fear them<br>
        But no matter what it is we love these creatures to our untimely death within it's jaws, and it's something that Orcas just can't give u</p>
